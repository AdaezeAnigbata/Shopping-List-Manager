# Shopping List Manager 🛒

A simple, interactive web application built to demonstrate JavaScript Array Methods. I created this as a deliverable to demonstrate how JavaScript array methods such as .map(), .filter(), and .reduce() work in a real-world context.

## 🚀 Overview

This project acts as a store inventory system. It starts with a default list of products (Apple, Bread, Milk, etc.) and allows users to perform various operations to manipulate or analyze the data.

## ✨ Key Features

- **View Inventory:** Uses `.map()` to display a formatted list of all items.
- **Filter Deals:** Uses `.filter()` to instantly find items under $10.
- **Calculate Total:** Uses `.reduce()` to sum up the price of the entire cart.
- **Inventory Control:**
- **Push:** Adds "Chips" to the list.
- **Pop:** Removes the last item.
- **Shift:** Removes the first item.
- **Splice:** Removes specific items (like the Laptop).
- **Audit System:** Uses `.forEach()` to generate a printed "receipt" in the display box.
- **Search & Sort:** Includes functionality to find specific items or sort by price (Low to High).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** Responsive design using CSS Grid for layout, Flexbox for alignment, and Media Queries for mobile compatibility.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Strict mode, Arrow functions, Array manipulation and Objects.
